From Mick LaSalle, SFGate:
This is how it is with Paul McCartney and me.  Never met the guy.   Never saw him in concert.  (I almost went in 1976, but the tickets were  too expensive.  Probably $15 or something.)  Half the time I haven’t  even liked him — or PRETENDED to myself not to like him, for a variety  of reasons, but mainly in the way that people love to define themselves,  when they’re young, in terms of their likes and dislikes.  So since I  was a John Lennon fanatic — and still am, in a big way — that  automatically meant that McCartney was no good.
And yet, probably more than any living artist, McCartney has been the one who has most often been in my head.
This is how far we go back.  In February of 1964, I was four years  old and saw the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, and in that weird way  that small children have, I became very embarrassed (why embarrassed?)  that McCartney, to my eyes, looked exactly like ME.   I felt like I was  looking at my own face, and I was afraid, for some reason, that someone  else would notice it.  No one did.
At least not until May 3, 1975, when I was in high school.  I was at a  party, and I was standing in a girl’s room.  I was a sophomore, and she  was a freshman.  And I noticed that she had a picture of McCartney (the  White Album used to come with these color 8 x 10s of each Beatle)  framed and leaning against the dresser mirror.  I said, “You know, he  looks like me.”  She said, “Yeah, right,” and I said, “Look.”  I held  the picture up to my face, widened my eyes, put on a blank expression  and sang one word, “Yesterday!”  She laughed, but a look crossed her  face like Hmmm.  She was my girlfriend for three of the next four years.
I should have appreciated that this guy did for me what I could never  have done for myself — he got me a girlfriend.  But McCartney was  always a difficult guy to endorse completely.  He’d do great work like  LET ME ROLL IT and 1985, and irresistible stuff like JUNIOR’S FARM and  ROCK SHOW, and then hit you with garbage like SILLY LOVE SONGS and LET  ‘EM IN.  And yet, even then . . . it was always easier to dislike  McCartney’s music when it WASN’T playing.
It only later occurred to me that McCartney — despite the fact that  most of his solo work didn’t interest me — was probably my second  favorite guy in pop music.
(A related affectation of youth.  When I was a teenager, I used to  say that I liked The Stones better than the Beatles, the Beatles better  than The Who and The Who better than the Stones.  I offered this as  myserious and impossible to solve, but of course this mystery is easy to  solve.  One of the statements is a lie.  I liked The Beatles, The Who  and The Stones in that order.  I just thought it was cooler to like The  Rolling Stones more than The Beatles.)
The man fascinates me.  Recently, Albert Maysles made a movie called  THE LOVE WE MAKE, which shows McCartney going around New York in October  of 2001, arranging a big concert for the 9/11 survivors.  Not the most  scintillating documentary, but I couldn’t stop watching it:  Everybody  who talked to McCartney — and I mean, even big stars like Ozzy or Billy  Joel — had an expression on their face like, “Oh, my God, Paul McCartney  is looking at me right now and talking.”  The only one who didn’t fall  apart — who was completely himself — was Bill Clinton.  Meanwhile, half  of everything out of McCartney’s mouth was banal or commonplace, but  people reacted like it was Moses coming back with an eleventh  commandment.  And if he ventured the slightest joke, everyone would fall  over laughing.  What a strange way to go through life.
Actually, it might be fun, but it can’t be good for your artistic  production.  You need a John Lennon there, someone that you’re a little  afraid might laugh at you.   And you definitely need to be in a good  marriage, because everyone needs ONE person who knows the truth.   McCartney had that for years.  Then he didn’t have it.  I hope he has it  now.
Another reason that as a kid I didn’t like McCartney (even though I  did)  is that I was convinced that HE was the one keeping the Beatles  from reuniting.  The truth was quite the opposite.
But I digress.  I even digress from my digression.
Here’s the point.  The man turns 70 years old today.  He has been  with me my whole life.  And in the words of the man himself, I would  just like to say . . . “But as for me/I still remember how it was  before/ And I am holding back the tears no more./I love you.”
Except I’m not weeping or anything.  But I do love the guy.
Happy Birthday.
