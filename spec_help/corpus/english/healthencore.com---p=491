					Lower Blood Pressure—Naturally
		
					
						How to get lower blood pressure naturally is a goal for many Americans. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is called “the silent killer” for a reason: it has no symptoms, yet it contributes to a host of potentially fatal diseases. In fact, a Harvard study indicates that high blood pressure is a contributing factor for 15 percent of deaths in the United States.
High blood pressure can lead to strokes, heart attacks, cognitive decline, kidney failure, and aneurysms, to name just a few. Consequently, if you have dangerously high blood pressure your doctor may immediately put you on medications that lower it. If so, follow your doctor’s instructions. Just know that there is a way to lower blood pressure naturally that can eventually wean you away from those medications.
5 Strategies to Lower Blood Pressure Naturally
The following are 5 proven strategies that lower blood pressure naturally. Incorporate a few of these into your life and watch your BP numbers fall!
1. Lose Weight
Obesity is a proven risk factor for hypertension. According to the Obesity Action Coalition, “the Framington Heart Study, a famous study for 44 years, estimated that excess body weight (including overweight and obesity), accounted for approximately 26 percent of cases of hypertension in men and 28 percent in women.”
But you don’t have to quickly shed 50 pounds in order to lower your blood pressure        naturally. Rather, another study has shown that even a slight weight loss of 10 percent can significantly lower your blood pressure.
2. Exercise
Include plenty of cardio into your exercise routine. (Strive for at least 30 minutes of vigorous cardio per day). Try taking brisk walks. According to Prevention, “hypertensive patients who went for fitness walks at a brisk pace lowered pressure by almost 8 mmhg over 6 mmhg.”
The reason why cardio works so well to lower your blood pressure is that it helps your heart use oxygen more efficiently. Consequently, your heart will not have to pump as hard.
3. Meditate
Meditation is an excellent (and effortless) way to lower blood pressure naturally. You can start out doing 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening, and then gradually increase to 20 minutes at a sitting.
And it’s easy.
Follow these steps and you will be meditating in no time:
Step 1: 
Go to a room where you will not be disturbed for at least 10 or 20 minutes.
Step 2:
Close the curtains or draw the blinds to make the room as dark as possible.  If you prefer, you may play soft, meditative music (instrumental only) and light incense and candles.
Step 3:
Sit down in a straight back chair. Sit up straight with your hands in your lap (or each hand on each knee), eyes looking straight ahead. Close your eyes.
Step 4:
Slowly inhale, filling your lungs completely.
Step 5:
Slowly exhale, emptying your lungs completely.
Step 6:
Continue slowly inhaling and exhaling for the remainder of your meditation. Concentrate totally on your breaths. Feel the sensation of the breath entering your nostrils and traveling down to your lungs. Feel the breath leaving your lungs and your nostrils on every exhale. Whenever a thought pops into your mind—and they will, almost constantly at first—just gently bring your attention back to your breath.
There. You’re meditating. It’s not more complicated than that.
4. Take Coenzyme Q10
 
Coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant that has been proven to lower blood pressure naturally by dilating blood vessels. The pressure lowering affects of this supplement are truly amazing. As Prevention says, “in a review of 12 studies, researchers found that coenzyme Q10 reduced blood pressure by up to 17 mmhg over 10 mmhg.”
Ask your doctor if coenzyme Q10 is a supplement that you should start taking to help lower your blood pressure.
5. Limit your Salt Intake
Many people’s hypertension is partially due to salt (or sodium) sensitivity. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell which person is sodium sensitive. Therefore, experts advise that everyone limit their salt intake to 1,500 mg per day.
But that might not be so easy. A half teaspoon of salt contains about 1,200 mg of sodium. Besides, that’s not where most of the sodium in your diet comes from. Most of your sodium intake comes from processed foods, so read those package labels carefully. It may take a lot of research to limit your sodium intake, but the effect it may have on your blood pressure is well worth it.
If you follow these 5 strategies to lower blood pressure naturally, you should be able to toss your blood pressure meds soon. Just be sure to ask your doctor’s permission first!
