	While older collectors will be scrambling for pairs of the "South Beach" Nike LeBron 9 Elite in early June, young sneakerheads will be treated to their very own colorway of the standard version. Pictured here is the Toddler "South Beach" 9, featuring a grey synthetic and Flywire base, black textile wings and Miami-inspired green and pink highlights throughout.

	Look for these to hit Nike retail locations in the coming weeks.
